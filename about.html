			<h2>My Journey</h2>
			<p>I am a dedicated and resourceful individual with a broad skill set in building maintenance, construction, desktop support, and customer service. Currently, I serve as a Building Engineer at ASEC in El Segundo, CA, where I manage various tasks, including drywall and stucco patching, interior and exterior painting, soldering, and handling high and low voltage electronics and HVAC systems. My strengths lie in diagnosing and troubleshooting issues efficiently, delivering high-quality work, and consistently providing exceptional customer service.</p>
			<p>My career foundation was built as an <b><u>Eagle Scout</u></b>, where I developed a strong sense of duty, leadership, and commitment to community service. Over the years, I have gathered extensive experience across multiple domains, including building maintenance and operations. In addition to my technical skills, I have honed my customer service abilities through roles that demanded direct client interaction. My time as Museum Maintenance at the Zimmerman Automobile Museum further refined my skills in event organization, maintaining the pristine condition of classic cars, and leading floor operations.</p>
			<p>Earlier in my career, I worked as a Meat Clerk at Ralphs, managing the seafood department and training new employees, demonstrating both leadership and customer service capabilities. Additionally, my experience in general contracting allowed me to handle various tasks such as electrical wiring, cabinetry installation, flooring, and painting projects, all with a focus on high-quality results and attention to detail.</p>
			<p>Beyond my professional life, I am passionate about continuous learning and self-improvement. I strive to stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies to provide the best possible service in my field. My hobbies include programming, hiking, camping, going to the beach, geiger counting, tinkering with electronics, and participating in community projects. These activities not only bring me personal fulfillment but also help me develop new skills and connect with like-minded individuals.</p>
			<p>In addition to my technical expertise and hands-on experience, I am also committed to fostering a collaborative and supportive work environment. I believe that the key to success lies in teamwork, effective communication, and continuous learning. Whether working on complex projects or solving day-to-day challenges, I approach every task with a positive attitude and a focus on achieving the best possible outcome. My goal is to not only excel in my field but also to inspire and uplift those around me, creating a culture of excellence and mutual respect.</p>
			<p>I am always open to new opportunities and challenges that allow me to leverage my skills and experience while making a positive contribution to my community and profession. My journey is driven by a commitment to excellence and a desire to make a meaningful impact in everything I do.</p>
