            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>I'm a dedicated and resourceful professional with a diverse skill set spanning building maintenance, security, desktop support, and customer service. Currently, I am a Building Engineer at ASEC in El Segundo, CA, where I handle tasks such as drywall and stucco patching, interior and exterior painting, soldering, and managing high and low voltage electronics and HVAC systems.</p>
            <p>My career began as an Eagle Scout, instilling in me a strong sense of duty, leadership, and community service. Over the years, I have accumulated extensive experience in various fields, including building maintenance and security operations. In addition to my technical skills, I excel in customer service, having worked in roles that required direct interaction with clients and the public. My time as a Museum Docent at the Zimmerman Automobile Museum further honed my abilities in organizing events and maintaining detailed cleanliness of classic cars.</p>
            <p>I also have a background in security, having served as a Security Guard for Allied Universal, where I oversaw the protection of high-profile clientele and led the day shift team. This role required a high level of professionalism and courtesy, enhancing the organization's reputation. My technical expertise includes end-user support for Microsoft operating systems and hardware/software troubleshooting, gained during my internship as a Desktop Analyst at 1872 Consulting. I also maintained network integrity and executed day-to-day maintenance of network hardware and equipment.</p>
            <p>In my earlier career, I worked as a Meat Clerk at Ralphs, where I managed the seafood department and trained new employees, showcasing my leadership and customer service skills. My versatility extends to general contracting, where I handled electrical wiring, cabinetry installation, flooring, and painting projects.</p>
            <p>Beyond my professional life, I am passionate about continuous learning and self-improvement. I believe in staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies to provide the best possible service in my field. My hobbies include programming, hiking, camping, tinkering with electronics, and participating in community projects. These activities not only provide me with a sense of fulfillment but also help me develop new skills and connect with like-minded individuals.</p>
            <p>I am always open to new opportunities and challenges that allow me to leverage my skills and experience while contributing positively to my community and profession. My journey is driven by a commitment to excellence and a desire to make a meaningful impact in everything I do.</p>
