			<p>Currently serving as a <b><u>Critical Operations Technician</u></b> at Prime Data Centers, I manage essential tasks in a critical environment, including the monitoring, maintenance, and operation of both electrical and mechanical systems, specifically Chillers, RTUs, CRACs, CRAHs, STSs, PDUs, UPSs, MSBs, and emergency backup generators.</p>
			<p>Prior to this, I operated as a <u>Building Engineer</u> at ASEC/Lakers in El Segundo, CA,where I managed essential tasks including plumbing, drywall and stucco repairs, and interior and exterior painting. I also oversaw critical infrastructure, including UPSs, STSs, ATSs, CRAC units and emergency backup generators. My role required efficiently diagnosing issues and ensuring that all work was completed to the highest standards, maintaining the facility’s 5-star quality for the owners.</p>
			<p>My career foundation was built as an <u>Eagle Scout</u>, where I developed a strong sense of teamwork, leadership, and commitment to community service. Over the years, I have gained extensive experience across multiple domains, including construction, building maintenance, and operations. In addition to my technical skills, I’ve honed my customer service abilities through roles that required direct client interaction.</p>
			<p>Beyond my professional life, I am passionate about continuous learning and self-improvement. I strive to stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies to provide the best possible service in my field. My hobbies include astronomy, geography, hiking, camping, tinkering with electronics, and participating in community projects. These activities not only bring me personal fulfillment but also help me develop new skills and connect with like-minded individuals.</p>
			<p>I am always open to new opportunities and challenges that allow me to leverage my skills and experience while making a positive contribution to my community and profession. My journey is driven by a commitment to excellence and a desire to make a meaningful impact in everything I do.</p>
			<p>In addition to my technical expertise and hands-on experience, I also care about creating a team environment where people feel supported and valued. I’ve found that clear communication, teamwork, and a willingness to learn make tackling any challenge easier and more rewarding. Whether it’s a big project or just solving day-to-day problems, I try to approach everything with a positive attitude and a focus on doing the best job possible, while helping those around me grow and succeed too.</p>
